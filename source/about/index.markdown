Hi, I'm Gast√≥n Nola. I'm a developer, living in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montevideo">Montevideo, Uruguay</a> with my lovely wife and son. 

I love programming, learning new languages and technologies, and usually write about those topics. However, since this is also a personal blog, I occasionally write about other (tangentially related) things like videogames, free software, intellectual property or books.

If you want to contact me, go ahead and send me an email to gaston@codingbugs.net .
